Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our "Headless" architecture and user data seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

How to Report

Please report security issues directly to the developer, Karunya K. P., via:

LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/karunyakp

GitHub: github.com/karunyakp

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for sensitive security vulnerabilities.

Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours.

We will provide an estimated timeframe for a fix if the vulnerability is validated.

We ask that you refrain from public disclosure until the issue has been resolved.

Note on Architecture

Please note that this repository intentionally excludes secrets.toml, API keys, and System Prompts as part of its IP Protection Protocol.

Reports stating that "API keys are missing" or "The app crashes without configuration" are expected behavior and will not be considered security vulnerabilities.
